            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
              As a young man, the blacksmith Godot lived in a castle town far
              from the hut he would one day call home. When the castle town's
              sovereign, a king, sent out a proclamation to all of his vassals
              to forge a sword capable of killing a dragon, Godot's liege lord
              entrusted him with the task of doing so. Tired of crafting ornate
              weapons for nobles who seek elegance in their armaments, Godot
              took the task seriously, creating the huge, but unusable, Dragon
              Slayer. Angry at how crude and impractical the Dragon Slayer was,
              Godot's liege lord threatened the blacksmith's life, forcing Godot
              to flee the castle town and settle down at his mine.

            <h2>Story</h2>
            <p>
              The Dragon Slayer was kept in storage for years until it is
              discovered by Guts during a fight against an unidentified roaming
              apostle, where the Black Swordsman wields it with ease and slays
              the apostle in two swings, shocking Godot, who thought the sword's
              weight made it unusable as a weapon.[5] Embarking on a warpath
              against demonkind afterward, Guts makes effective use of the
              Dragon Slayer against evil spirits, possessed monsters, and
              particularly apostles. When Guts returns to Godot's abode two
              years later, Godot sees the wear and tear the Dragon Slayer has
              been put through and decides to reforge it.
            </p>
            <p>
              When Slan manifests a rudimentary form in Qliphoth to meet Guts,
              the Skull Knight intervenes and notes that the Dragon Slayer has
              been tempered by the malice of the countless malevolent astral
              beings it has slain, and is therefore capable of wounding Slan's
              assumed form. With this knowledge, Guts runs the Dragon Slayer
              through Slan, causing the abrupt dissipation of her troll guts
              form.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the bay of Vritannis, during Guts' battle with the Kushan
              wizard general Daiba, the Dragon Slayer is imbued with the power
              of a fire spirit of woe summoned by Schierke. Guts uses the
              empowered sword to deal a blazing blast to the Kundalini aiding
              Daiba, causing the magical beast's large water form to
              dematerialize.

        <ul>
          <li>
            The Dragon Slayer's width also allows Guts to use it defensively, in
            lieu of a shield.
          </li>
          <li>
            Given the sword's incredible size and weight, the Dragon Slayer
            functions more like a bladed maul than an actual sword, though Guts
            is more than capable of using it to cut through various targets. The
            sheer momentum of Guts swinging it can tear anyone caught in the
            attack impact into pieces with one swing; this often is applied to
            more than one enemy at once, cleaving through multiple foes in a
            single swing. Even apostles in their true forms can barely stand up
            to the sword, and often have their bones and internal organs heavily
            damaged by an attack from the weapon. This size and weight also
            grants the Dragon Slayer some versatility, as Guts has used the
            broad side of the weapon to squash and flatten several opponents.
          </li>
          <li>
            When Guts activates his Berserker Armor, his resulting inhuman
            physicality and ferocity allow him to use the Dragon Slayer to
            significantly greater effect. Standard apostles are slain in a
            matter of seconds, and other even larger enemies are cut down just
            as easily, sometimes in droves. With such superhuman strength behind
            it, the Dragon Slayer's cutting power becomes considerable; while
            wielded by a Berserker Guts, it is capable of breaking through
            Grunbeld's cannon fire-repelling shield, and even the corundum skin
            of the dragon-apostle's true form, which is said to be stronger than
            steel.
          </li>
          <li>
            Due to having been used to slay countless apostles, pseudo-apostles,
            and other malevolent astral entities, the Dragon Slayer has been
            tempered by the malice of such beings. As a result, the sword has
            become more effective against monsters and evil spirits, capable of
            wounding even profound entities such as the Sea God and the assumed
            forms of members of the God Hand.Due to having been used to slay
